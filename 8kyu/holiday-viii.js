//Description: 
// The purpose of this kata is to work out just how many bottles of duty free whiskey 
// you would have to buy such that the saving over the normal high street price would 
// effectively cover the cost of your holiday. You will be given the high street price 
// (normPrice), the duty free discount (discount) and the cost of the holiday.

//My solutions:
function dutyFree(normPrice, discount, hol){
    return Math.floor(hol / (normPrice * discount * 0.01))
}
