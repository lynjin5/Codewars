//Descriptions: 
//Your inputs: a positive integer, n, greater or equal to one. n is provided, 
//you have no control over its value. Your expected output is an array of positive integers
//from 1 to n(inclusive). Write an algorithm that gets you from input to output. 

//My solutions:
function preFizz(n){
    let arr = []
    for(let i=1; i<=n; i++){
        arr.push(i)
    }return arr
}
