//Descriptions: 
// Your friend is traveling abroad to the United States so he wrote a program to 
//convert fahrenheit to celsius. Unfortunately his code has some bugs.
// Find the errors in the code to get the celsius converter working properly.
// To convert fahrenheit to celsius:
// celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * (5/9)

//My solutions:
function weatherInfo(temp){
        let c = (temp - 32) * 5/9
    if (c<=0){
          return c + ' is freezing temperature'
    }else{
          return c + ' is above freezing temperature'
    }
}
